# Tiny Tapeout project information
project:
  title:        "Field Programmable Resistor Network"      # Project title
  author:       "htfab"      # Your name
  discord:      "h.tamas"      # Your discord username, for communication and automatically assigning you a Tapeout role (optional)
  description:  "A few resistors and switches wired up in a matrix pattern."      # One line description of what your project does
  language:     "Analog" # other examples include Verilog, Amaranth, VHDL, etc
  clock_hz:     0       # Clock frequency in Hz (or 0 if not applicable)

  # How many tiles your design occupies? A single tile is about 167x108 uM.
  tiles: "1x2"          # Valid values: 1x1 (digital only), 1x2, 2x2, 3x2, 4x2, 6x2 or 8x2

  # How many analog pins does your project use?
  analog_pins: 1        # Valid values: 0 to 6

  # Your top module name must start with "tt_um_". Make it unique by including your github username:
